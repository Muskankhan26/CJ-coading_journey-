# 🐍 Python Journey

This folder contains my weekly Python learning notes, code snippets, and practice programs.  
I will update it week by week as I complete modules and practice exercises.  

📌 Structure:  
- Week 1 → Basics of Python (syntax, variables, operations)  
- Week 2 → Control structures and functions  
- Week 3 → Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)  
- Week 4+ → More advanced topics
